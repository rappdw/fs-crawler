Please analyze this repo. I want to use it to extract a large portion (all?) of the parent child relationships from FamilySearch.org. THis will require keeping track of visited nodes in the graph and will not fit in memory. Also, we need to be mindful and polite with the number of requests that are made. While I want to this to proceed in a reasonable amount of time, I don't want to overwelm the service. ALso, would like to be able to suspend or cancel a crawl and pick up again at a later point. Please formulate a plan to do so. Break it down into discrete steps, show me the plan and then we'll select the steps to work on at any given point in time. Place that plan in `.plans/refactor.md`. Feel free to look for general code quality issues as well.
