# FamilySearch crawler
A python module that crawls FamilySearch. The crawler will extract vertices and edges in the format required for
ingestion into a [RedBlackGraph](https://github.com/rappdw/redblackgraph).

This implementation was inspired by [getmyancestors](https://github.com/Linekio/getmyancestors).
